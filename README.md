# TI Companion Plus

A spinoff of [Terra Invicta Companion](https://github.com/b4p3p/terrainvicta-companion)
by b4p3p, with extra features. The original companion is their work; this project builds
on it separately.

A second-screen companion for [Terra Invicta](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1176470/Terra_Invicta/).
It reads your save files and puts side by side what the game spreads across a dozen
screens: your council and what it can do, which missions you can run and where, nations,
rival factions, space, technologies, and what changed since the previous save.

There is no hosted site yet: run it locally (see below).

| Council | History |
|---|---|
| ![Council: attribute coverage and the team](docs/screenshots/council.png) | ![History: every save archived, charted over time](docs/screenshots/history.png) |

![Mining: base sites ranked by yield, and the orgs with space bonuses](docs/screenshots/mining.png)

It is a **reading aid, not a cheat**. The interface only shows information the game
already gives you: apparent loyalty, not real loyalty; no intel you haven't gathered; a
site's real mining yield only once you've probed its body. Where a number is this tool's
own heuristic rather than the game's formula, it says so and shows the raw values next
to it.

## What it shows

- **Overview** — alerts checked on every save, monthly flows, the research race against
  the other factions.
- **Council** — attribute coverage, missions nobody on the council can run, which recruit
  candidates would fill the gaps, org requirements.
- **Missions** — the real attacking and defending modifiers of each mission, taken from
  the game templates, with targets ranked on readable factors.
- **Nations** — control points, GDP, cohesion, unrest, trends over time; not-yet-born
  separatist states filtered out so they stop skewing every ranking.
- **Factions** — rival factions and their councilors, compared only on what your intel
  unlocks, with the game's own thresholds.
- **Space** — visible habitats, Earth orbits and their free slots, buildable modules and
  when you can afford them.
- **Mining** — every base site ranked by yield (real numbers on prospected bodies, the
  game's range elsewhere), and the orgs with space bonuses: yours, on your market, and
  rival ones as Hostile Takeover targets.
- **Technologies** — what each available tech unlocks for your faction, with the game's
  own project-unlock chance.
- **Presets** — custom national priority presets written as game files, without mods, so
  achievements stay enabled.
- **History, notes and goals** — every save archived per campaign, turn-to-turn diffs,
  exportable.
- **14 game languages** — mission, org and project names come from the game's official
  localization, never hand-translated. Interface in English and Italian.

## Two ways to run it

### In the browser (recommended)

Open the interface in **Chrome or Edge** on the PC where Terra Invicta is installed and pick
the `My Games` or `TerraInvicta` folder inside Documents: it finds the saves and reloads
on every save. The whole Python core runs in the page through
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) (the first visit downloads about 13 MB). Saves are never
uploaded, and the tool never writes to them. The demo works in any browser.

### Locally, with the Python API

Requirements: Terra Invicta installed, Python 3.10+, Node.js 20+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joesco726/ti-companion-plus.git
cd ti-companion-plus
pip install -e .
cd tiweb && npm install && cd ..
```

On Windows, both services plus the browser:

```powershell
.\start.ps1                  # API on :8733, interface on :3033
.\start.ps1 -NoBrowser
.\start.ps1 -NoReload        # no API auto-reload on source changes
```

Or separately:

```bash
python -m uvicorn tiserver.main:app --port 8733
cd tiweb && npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3033>. The local API watches the save folder and pushes
changes over SSE; history is kept in SQLite in `~/.ti-companion-plus/`.

## CLI

`ti.py` is a thin layer over `ticore`, useful without a browser:

```bash
python ti.py status                 # default command
python ti.py council
python ti.py missions
python ti.py plan GainInfluence     # targets for a mission, ranked
python ti.py nations --all          # drop the Europe-only filter
python ti.py diff                   # what changed since the previous save
python ti.py alerts
python ti.py --list-saves
```

Useful flags: `--save <name or fragment>`, `--lang ita|en|fr|deu|…`, `--limit N`,
`--councilor <name>`, `--eu`.

## Architecture

```
ticore/     parser and domain logic. Python, zero dependencies, no UI.
tiserver/   FastAPI wrapper: /api/*, SSE on /api/stream, save-file watcher.
tiweb/      Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind 4 + TypeScript.
ti.py       CLI on top of ticore.
```

`ticore` is deliberately dependency-free and UI-free: the same code serves the local API
and, compiled to WebAssembly, the browser version. Its routes live in `service.py`
without any web framework; `tiserver` and the browser worker
(`tiweb/public/engine-worker.js`) both call `Service.dispatch()`.

| module | contents |
|---|---|
| `paths.py` | locates saves, templates, localization, data folder |
| `save.py` | loads the gzipped save and indexes gamestates; survives the file being locked while the game writes it |
| `gamedata.py` | JSON templates plus official localization in 14 languages |
| `names.py` | translates names the save stores in the game's language back through their template keys |
| `council.py` | councilors (attributes with trait effects), orgs, coverage, missing missions |
| `missions.py` | real mission factors and ranked targets |
| `model.py` | `snapshot()`: the full payload, control-point capacity |
| `alerts.py` | rule engine over consecutive snapshots |
| `factions.py` | rival factions and councilors, gated by intel like the game's own views |
| `space.py` | habitats, Earth orbits, buildable modules and their cost |
| `mining.py` | mining sites (real yield or the game's estimate) and orgs with space bonuses |
| `techs.py` | available techs and what they unlock for your faction |
| `presets.py` | priority presets, written into the game's template files without mods |
| `service.py` | the `/api/*` routes, shared by the server and the browser |
| `store.py` | SQLite: history, notes, goals, per campaign |
| `portable.py` | export and merge-import of the companion's data |
| `bundle.py` | the game-data extract used by the browser version |

### API

`/api/health` · `/api/snapshot?lang=` · `/api/alerts` · `/api/missions` ·
`/api/missions/{name}/plan` · `/api/nations/trends` · `/api/nations/{name}/detail` ·
`/api/factions` (+ `councilors`) · `/api/space` · `/api/mining` · `/api/techs` ·
`/api/research` · `/api/presets` (+ `export`, `install`, `restore`, `custom`) ·
`/api/history` · `/api/campaigns` · `/api/diff` · `/api/notes` · `/api/goals` ·
`/api/data` (+ `export`, `import`) · `/api/saves` · `/api/languages` · `/api/stream` (SSE)

## Where the game data comes from

- **Saves** — `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\TerraInvicta\Saves\*.gz` (OneDrive-redirected
  Documents included). If neither exists, the path is read from `savedGamesPath` in the
  game's `Player.log`.
- **Templates and localization** — the local version reads them from your installation,
  `<Steam>\steamapps\common\Terra Invicta\TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\`, in any
  Steam library (or the folder in `TI_GAME_DIR`, if set). The
  browser can't reach that folder, so the site serves a minimal extract generated by
  `python -m ticore.bundle`. The extract is not stored in this repository.
- **Icons** — `assets/icons/` holds the mission, resource, faction and cursor icons. In
  the game they live inside Unity asset bundles, not as files; if a mission, resource or
  faction icon is missing, the local server re-extracts it from your own copy of the game
  (`pip install -e ".[icons]"` pulls in UnityPy for that).

## Feedback

Any request, bug report or suggestion is welcome: something the game shows that you'd
like side by side, a number that doesn't match what you see in game, a screen that's
confusing. [Open an issue](https://github.com/joesco726/ti-companion-plus/issues) and
I'll take a look.
